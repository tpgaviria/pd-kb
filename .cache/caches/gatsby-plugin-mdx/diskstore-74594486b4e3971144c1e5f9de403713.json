This application provides a comprehensive visualization of the clusters of alerts and events occurring across your IT infrastructure and delivers infrastructure-wide context that is vital for improving incident management within your organization. With a comprehensive timeline of events, IT teams are able to view their alert clusters across services or tech stacks in a graphical and easy to understand interface that is ideal for pattern matching. With all the data in one place, organizations can finally gain an understanding of their ever expanding infrastructure and begin to measure performance across their critical apps and services.
