Assignment via Escalation Policies and Schedules\nUnlike an alert or a suppressed event, an incident must be assigned to a user. The escalation policy determines whom an incident is assigned to. An escalation policy has one or more levels, and can accept either a schedule or a user as a target. An incident will escalate through the layers of an escalation policy until it finds someone who is on-call. This user will be notified and the incident will be assigned to them. If the user fails to acknowledge the incident before the time limit set on the escalation policy, the incident escalates to the next escalation level.`}</p>\n    <p>{`##3.

Acknowledging and Resolving\nNotifications provide a way for responders to acknowledge that they're working on an incident or it's been resolved.

If the incident is not resolved before the end of the service's acknowledgement timeout, it re-triggers and continues to escalate.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Manually resolving an incident in the web UI will prompt a confirmation box with a final Resolve Incident button.
