In cases where ITSM systems are used with monitoring tools, it often results in a “swivel-chair” workflow: in this form of integration, a user works directly with a monitoring tool; then when they determine an incident is occurring, they switch applications and manually create a ticket in the ITSM system, using clipboard cut-and-paste to move the data over. This workflow is cumbersome, error-prone, and provides no direct linkage between operational data and ITSM tickets.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Using PagerDuty to integrate monitoring tools and ITSM systems results in an improved workflow. `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/services-and-integrations#section-add-integrations-to-an-existing-service\"\n      }}>{`Integrating a monitoring tool`}</a>{` with PagerDuty is extremely simple, and can often be completed in just a few minutes. Once the monitoring tool is integrated, events will be sent to PagerDuty, where they can be routed to services and turn into an incident, have event rules applied, be filtered out if appropriate, and much more. Any incident that requires attention will be automatically assigned to the appropriate responder according to scheduled on-call rotations. For straightforward issues, the initial responder can handle the issue directly; in other cases the responder will triage the incident and classify it using the established `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/incident-priority\"\n      }}>{`incident priority`}</a>{` levels.`}</p>\n    <p>{`At this point, many organizations will want to have an ITSM ticket created to track the incident.
