You will need to be an Account Owner or Admin user to change another user's role in your PagerDuty account. You will not be able to change your own user role unless you are the account owner.

To change a user's role:
1 . Go to **People > Users**.
2. Select the user you would like to update by clicking their name.
3 .Click on the **User Settings** tab in the user's profile page.
4. Click on the **Edit** icon to the right of the Role section and use the dropdown menu to select a new Role.
5. Click **Save**.
