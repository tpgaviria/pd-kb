PagerDuty's web app requires a modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.

We recommend using the most recent production release of the browser(s) you work in. Older versions and pre-release browsers, such as betas or developer previews, are not supported. Issues with a pre-release version of a browser should be reported to the browser vendor.

Browser extensions, such as ad or JavaScript blockers, can interfere with or completely prevent certain features from working correctly, and are not supported. We recommend safelisting `*.pagerduty.com` in these extensions so that they won't prevent you from accessing and using PagerDuty web apps.

The following browsers are tested and supported:

We support the latest version of the PagerDuty app available from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store on devices running iOS 11 and higher or Android 5.0 and higher. For more information, see [Using the Mobile App](doc:mobile-app).

Logging in to the Pagerduty app requires a browser installed on your device.  If you are using an Android **work profile**, the profile must be configured to be able to access a browser.  This can be done either by adding the browser into the work profile, or allowing data to be passed outside of the work profile.  Please refer to [Android's Documentation](https://developer.android.com/work/managed-profiles) to understand more about setting up work profiles.
