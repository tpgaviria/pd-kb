Business services allow you to model capabilities that span multiple technical services and that may be owned by several different teams. Mapping [technical services](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/services-and-integrations#section-configuring-services-and-integrations) to business services gives responders context on an incidentâ€™s impact to the business. The [status dashboard](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/status-dashboard) uses this feature to let non-technical stakeholders see when there is an incident affecting one of the business services they care about.

Ideally, business services are:

* Recognizable to non-technical stakeholders
* Supported by 1 or more technical services in PagerDuty
* Can have clearly defined [impact metrics](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/impact-metrics) that are meaningful to non-technical services

You may have business services listed on an external status page, within a service catalog/CMDB, or defined in relation to existing health metrics from a monitoring tool.

##Supporting Services

Supporting services are [technical services](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/services-and-integrations) or other business services that a business service requires in order to be considered operational. If one of the supporting services mapped to a business service experiences an incident with a [priority](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/incident-priority) assigned, this business service will be impacted and appear on the status dashboard.

You can configure business services to set a threshold for which priority levels will change their status to impacted. For example, you may want to set a threshold so that only P1 and P2 incidents impact a business service.

To set a priority threshold:

1. Navigate to **Services** :fa-arrow-right: **Business Services** :fa-arrow-right: :fa-cog:.
2. Select the **If a supporting technical service has an open incident with a priority at or above** radio button and select your preferred priority level threshold.
3. Click **Save Changes**.

##Edit or Delete a Business Service

To edit all business service incident settings:

1. Navigate to **Services** :fa-arrow-right: **Business Services** and click the :fa-cog:.
2. Select when you would like business services to show an incident: 
   * **If a supporting technical service has an open incident with any priority assigned**
*or*
   * **If a supporting technical service has an open incident with a priority at or above** and select the **priority level**. 
3. Click **Save Changes**. 

To edit the an individual business service: 

1. Navigate to **Services** :fa-arrow-right: **Business Services**, click the **name** of the desired business service and click **Edit Business Service**.
2.  Edit the details you wish to change and click **Save Changes**. If you are deleting your business service, click **Delete Business Service**.
