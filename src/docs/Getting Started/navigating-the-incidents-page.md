The top of the dashboard shows any triggered or acknowledged incidents currently active in the account. In the example below, there is currently 1 triggered incident and 1 acknowledged incident in PagerDuty. The left side will show triggered and acknowledged incidents specifically assigned to you and the right side will show a total of all triggered or acknowledged incidents in thePagerDuty account. If there is a triggered incident the text will be red, and if there is an acknowledged incident the text will be orange. If there are no open incidents, the text will remain black.

Just below this module you will see details of  specific incidents that are assigned to you, as well as all incidents within PagerDuty. To view incidents assigned to you specifically, you can click on **Assigned to me**. To view all incidents in PagerDuty, you can click on **All**. Depending on your selection, you can view  open incidents, triggered incidents, acknowledged incidents, resolved incidents, or any status specifically assigned to you or everyone in the account. Also, you can resolve, acknowledge, or reassign an incident directly from the dashboard by checking the incident and clicking the resolve, acknowledge, or reassign button.
