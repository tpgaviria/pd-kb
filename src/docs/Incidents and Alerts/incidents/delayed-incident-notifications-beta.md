As a new [Rulesets](doc:rulesets) feature, paused incident notifications allows rules to be set to create alerts, but pause incident creation and notifications for a predefined amount of time. During the pause period, new alerts will be viewable in the [Alerts table](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/alerts#alerts-table) with a **Suspended** status. These suspended alerts have new actions, allowing users to **Trigger** an incident from the alert during the pause period, or **Resolve** the alert, preventing the incident and its notifications from being created altogether.

## View and Take Action on Paused Alerts

To view alerts in a paused state, navigate to the **Services** and then **Alerts** in the upper menu of the web app under the Incidents tab. Alerts with paused incident notifications will have a **Suspended** status:

    }
  ]
}

To take action on a paused alert:

1. Click the incident **title** to view its details page.
2. On the right hand side, click **Trigger** to trigger an incident and send notifications, or **Resolve** if you would like to resolve the alert without triggering an incident/notifications. You will see a green dialog that confirms that the alert has been triggered or resolved.
