Admin Subscription Management is a feature that allows Admins to opt-in all employees, or specific employees, to automatically receive Business Service incident updates. Admins may choose to subscribe all users to Business Services as part of their PagerDuty account setup, making users aware of Business Service subscription capabilities. Increase the number of users subscribed to Business Services and incidents to keep stakeholder users engaged with PagerDuty incidents.
