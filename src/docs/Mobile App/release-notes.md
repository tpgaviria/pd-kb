**iOS**
- Version 5.35 is a special release just for you, **Edmund**! We've fixed the app icon so the top of the "p" and the top of the base of the "d" are properly aligned. (Once you pointed it out, we couldn't un-see it!)

Also, we're not gonna lie, bug fixes and performance improvements.

Thanks for all the great icon feedback! We’re always looking for ways to improve the app icon. Email <a href="mailto:support@pagerduty.com">support@pagerduty.com</a> with any icon comments.

**Android**
- We did a facelift on the empty incidents list. We hope you like it!

#5.34 —  1 Feb 2019
**iOS**
- The old set of tips that used to show when you have no incidents have been excised, and in its place a positive message has appeared.
- If you've ever tapped a push notification for an incident assigned to you and gotten "Incident not found", well, we've found those incidents. You won't see that anymore.
- Incidents you've acknowledged can now be unacknowledged in Incident Details, just like on the web.
- Your avatar in the menu is now round, just like your head.

#5.33 —  31 Jan 2019
**iOS**
- We've fixed a variety of issues related to Single Sign-On as well as better operation with Google Smart Lock. Should be smooth sailing from here on out.
- More indication of loading progress with our patented three-hundred-sixty-degree spinner technology.
- Thank you Jean from Schenectady who suggested we add "All Star" by Smash Mouth as a ringtone. Unfortunately we were not able to work out a licensing deal with Interscope, but we'll keep trying.

**Android**

#5.32 —  25 Jan 2019
**iOS**
- We sped up the Resolved Incidents list for most accounts. If you aren’t getting a speed boost, don’t feel bad… we didn’t single you out! It’s just that you already had the faster behavior.
- We replaced hyphens with en dashes (the em dash’s lesser-known partner) for ranges of things. If you’re a typography nerd or just someone of the most refined culture (adjusts bowtie) this is for you! Say thanks to Spencer when you see him.

**Android**
- A few tweaks and pokes to keep things running in tip-top shape.

#5.31 —  16 Jan 2019
**iOS**
- Another big revamp ("revamp" is an industry term meaning "reapply a vampire to") for the User screen. Now it reliably shows the user's on-call shifts for the next 14 days (in order!), instead of only the next shift per schedule. This is a big help for everyone, and the nocturnal in particular.
- "On-Call Timeline" is now called "My On-Call Shifts", and there's a link to it in the User screen. Sorry, a button, not a link. It's all the same to your finger.

#5.30 — 9 Jan 2019
**iOS**
It's the first release of 2019! You probably knew that because we were all ready for 2018 to end. We're going to be releasing more frequent and smaller updates this year.

- If you're a Team Responder (Legacy) on a team, and you're added as a responder for an incident from another team, you'll have the ability to Accept or Decline. It's funny because "Accept Decline" was my motto for 2018.
- We replaced all of our app icons. Normally I wouldn't tell you this but I want you to know there were a lot of sizes. A lot.
Thanks for all the great feedback! We’re always looking for ways to improve the app. Email <a href="mailto:support@pagerduty.com">support@pagerduty.com</a> with any comments.

**Android**
- Added good constraints and removed bad constraints on creating on-call overrides. Much better confirmation dialogs.

#5.29 — 12 Dec 2018
**iOS**
We're so excited by the response to the new Schedules feature, and we've heard your feedback and made some changes there and elsewhere:

- Cleared up the confirmation message for overrides when you're overriding yourself (hey, no shame in it), or overriding past the end of a shift into the next shift.
- Manually created incidents show who created them in the Timeline.
- In the User screen, no more anxiety-inducing warnings about notification rules and contact methods while the data is loading. The anxiety induction is now saved for after the data is loaded!
- Fixed the error banners that could appear when viewing an incident for a deleted service. (TIL you can delete a service! This product is full of delightful wonders.)
Thanks for all the great feedback! We’re always looking for ways to improve the app. Email <a href="mailto:support@pagerduty.com">support@pagerduty.com</a>  with any comments.

**Android** 
- Fixed a bug where Test Notifications sent from our website were silent on the device, or played the low-urgency sound. I think we are all agreed on the meaning of "Test Notification" now.
- Cleared up the confirmation message for overrides when you're overriding yourself (hey, no shame in it), or overriding past the end of a shift into the next shift.

#5.28 — 14 Nov 2018:
**iOS**
Schedules have been completely revamped! Quickly see who's on call for your team's (or any) schedules. Flip through the past to see who was on call, or head to the future to see who's going to be on call later. You can even book an override while you're there.

A similar list is also available in the user screen. Tap an on call there to immediately jump to that schedule at that time.

**Android**
Schedules have been completely revamped! Quickly see who's on call for any schedule. Flip through the past or future to see who was or will be on call, and even book an override in one place.

Push notifications are no longer treated as alarms.
Low-urgency notifications respect your in-app settings.
Non-incident notifications (on call handoffs, etc.) are no longer low-urgency.
Our apologies for the difficulties!

#5.26 — 03 Oct 2018
**iOS**
Our support for iOS 10 is being deprecated. As such, this is the last release devices on iOS 10 and below will receive. Rest assured, this release of the app will continue working for you should you remain on iOS 10.

For security reasons, this is also the last release for which we will allow insecure (plain HTTP) resource downloads (e.g. embedded images in incidents). To ensure your resources continue to appear in incidents, ensure you reference them by HTTPS.

What's New in Version 5.26:
- Fixed the display of incidents created through the Jira integration.
- Fixed the infamous bug (in certain circles, e.g. everyone who comes up to me and points it out) where you'd foreground the app and see "Request timed out".
- If you are the assignee and a coordinated responder for an incident, you now see ACK instead of ACCEPT.
- Fixed a strange bug where sections of the On-call Timeline would disappear after a few seconds.
- The search bar when assigning an override to a user is no longer teeny-tiny and is now the average size among its peers.
- Fixed a bug where you might look at a user to see their schedules and get an infinite "Loading..." message.

**Android**
What's New in Version 5.26:
- Fixed the display of incidents created through the Jira integration.
- If you are the assignee and a coordinated responder for an incident, you now see ACK instead of ACCEPT.
- Miscellaneous other crashes and bugfixes.

#5.25 — 12 Sep 2018
**iOS**
Introducing the new PagerDuty Visibility dashboard! See the operational status of your business services anytime, anywhere. When problems arise, see live performance indicators that quantify the real-time impact of incidents on customers and on the business. Available for Enterprise accounts and those with the PagerDuty Visibility add-on.

As well, we've taken care of the following:
- Merge multiple open incidents together by selecting them (long-press the first incident or choose Select Incidents), pick 'em all, then Change, then Merge.
- Fixed a funky iPhone X bug where the incident action buttons would appear in the unsafe area. You're safe now.
- Fixed a crash here and there, applied another coat of wax.

**iOS**

**Android**
- (Bug) Fixed an Oreo issue where the notification sound wouldn’t end when you tapped the notification
- (Bug) Fixed a bug where the notification sound would play even when you didn’t give our app priority in Do Not Disturb

#5.22 — 07 July 2018
**iOS**
What's New in Version 5.22, with handy Release Notes Translation Guide:
- Bug fixes => I fixed more bugs than I caused. Probably.
- Performance improvements => no code changes but I think the new Swift compiler will speed things up.
- Lots of work behind the scenes => ... on a different project.
- Addressed some crashes => we wrote them up in JIRA.
- Visual improvements => I moved some plants around in my work area.
- Fixed a crash in Open Incidents while Live Updating is enabled => we actually fixed this.

**Android**
What’s New in Version 5.22:
- Lots of work going on behind the scenes for new features. Stay tuned!

#5.21 — 20 Jun 2018
**iOS**
What's New in Version 5.21:
- Support for Universal Links! Links to incidents, escalation policies, and users that you tap from Safari, Mail, and Messages will now open in the PagerDuty app.**
- Improved navigation for VoiceOver users in some screens for improved accessibility.
- Fixed a crash when swiping an incident to Snooze, Acknowledge, or Resolve (under very specific conditions).
- Lots and lots of work going on under the hood for a new feature that'll make your on-call life easier.
** Despite the optimistic name, Universal Links are currently only supported on Earth.

**Android**
What’s New in Version 5.21:
- Fixed a crash and some bugs.

#5.20 — 30 May 2018
**iOS**
This special Moana Soundtrack Edition of the release notes for version 5.20 are brought to you courtesy of Lin-Manuel Miranda, Repeat All, and I guess my boss, who doesn't review these before I submit them anymore. She doesn't realize HOW FAR I'LL GO.
- Introducing enhanced incident-wrangling abilities with Priority! (Only available to users on Basic and above pricing plans.)
 - Create, edit and sort Incidents by Priority.
 - Incident Priority now displays in push notifications.
 - Incident Details enhancements now include one-click URLs and phone numbers!
- Users and decapods (look it up!) in the Observer role now have a "Mine" tab in Open Incidents. We're always trying to bring the most relevant information to WHERE YOU ARE.
- Lots of behind-the-scenes work going on for a SHINY new feature coming later this year. Early-access testers, you KNOW WHO YOU ARE!
- We've stripped down the size of the app for this update. What can we say except YOU'RE WELCOME?
- Some smaller bugs are fixed too, for smoother sailing. WE KNOW THE WAY to find 'em and squash 'em!

Thanks for all the great feedback! We’re always looking for ways to improve the app to be THE ROCK you rely on.

**Android**
What’s New in Version 5.20:

Priority! Create, edit and sort incidents by Priority on Basic (and above) pricing accounts.
Users in the Observer role now have a Mine tab on Open Incidents.
Fixed a bug that wasn't putting your device back into Do Not Disturb mode after overriding volume.
Sped up the Service selection for creating a new incident.

#5.19 — 09 May 2018
**iOS**
We crunched a lot of bugs this time around. Our shoes are a mess. Think of this like "PagerDuty Service Pack 1". What’s New in Version 5.19:
- 1Password integration! Forget all of your PagerDuty passwords with confidence!
- We sped up the schedule list and service selection. What will you do with all the extra time?
- Fixed a bug where you search for a service and pick one and it enters a different one. This happened just often enough to make you think you were going crazy but not often enough to be reported.
- The On-Call Selfie button has been removed. We still want to see your on-call selfies, just... y'know... from someone else's app.
- Fixed a bug when you search for a user and pick them and then you're still picking a user and you're like what even?
- Fixed a bug where the priority labels disappeared while multi-selecting incidents.
- Fixed a bug where (seriously) you turn your phone upside down and then right-side up and then the Open Incidents is empty. You can imagine how hard this was to diagnose.
- Lots of work under the hood for upcoming features. IT'S UNDER THE HOOD! Please stop peeking under the hood.
Thanks for all the great feedback! We’re always looking for ways to improve the app. Email support@pagerduty.com with any comments. We won't bug you while you're using the app to give us a rating, but since you're here, in the App Store, giving this a read, we'd appreciate your rating!

Today's rejected app suggestion comes from Jared in Tulsa, OK: "plz add a cat hairball ringtone". Thanks for your suggestion, Jared, but my cat has enough hairballs that this wouldn't even wake me up.

**Android**
What’s New in Version 5.19:
- Lots and lots of fixes to bugs reported by our users.
- Serious performance improvements!
- Lots of work under the hood for upcoming features.

#5.18 — 18 Apr 2018
**iOS**
Spring is in the air (several states and provinces excluded), and baseball is back! What could make life better, but a new PagerDuty release? What’s New in Version 5.18:
- Added a Force Touch shortcut to the app to create a new incident. Push hard on the icon (but not too hard, just kinda hard, like you're popping bubble wrap) to initiate.
- Fixed a couple small issues relating to scrolling and Live Updating. Honestly, the details would bore you.
- Setting "Mute Sound" on low-urgency notifications (available on eligible plans – contact sales@pagerduty.com to upgrade your plan) actually mutes the sound when the app is in the background. Since the PagerDuty app is usually in the background, this is great news. If your PagerDuty app is usually in the foreground, we're flattered.
- Users on plans without separate high- and low-urgency notification rules can now see their notification rules and add or delete them in the app!
- Fixed an issue displaying an empty space for the priority on incidents when some had priorities and some didn't (available on eligible plans).

**Android**
What’s New in Version 5.18:
- Fixed some crashes.
- Log entries for reassigning incidents now show who reassigned it.
- Various other tweaks 'n' stuff.

#5.17 — 28 Mar 2018
**iOS**
What’s New in Version 5.17:
- Some things are just better live: music, the musical Grease, sports (not baseball or curling)... and now PagerDuty! The Open Incidents list and Incident Details refresh themselves with space-age Live Updating technology. No more pulling to refresh! (Very minimal data is used, and you can turn off Live Updating in the Settings screen.)
- Phone numbers and URLs in responder requests and notes in the incident timeline are now tappable (and long-pressable for more options).
- Fixed a bug when searching Schedules where you couldn't pick a schedule. This is gonna do wonders for Schedules' sense of self-worth.

#5.16 — 07 Mar 2018
**iOS**
What’s New in Version 5.16:
My project manager: "So what do we announce for this new release?"
Me: "Uh, well, nothing in particular, we did a lot of cleaning up."
My project manager: "Sure, I get that, but what did you DO for the past three weeks?"
Me: "Would you accept 'bug fixes and performance improvements'?"
My project manager: "NO"
Me: "Okay, I promise I won't put that."

**Android**
What’s New in Version 5.16:
- Bug fixes and improvements

#5.15 — 02 Feb 2018
**iOS**
What’s New in Version 5.15:
- Low-urgency notification rules are now separated from high-urgency notification rules! You can edit your low-urgency rules in your profile, located in the side menu. (Low-urgency rules not available on Lite packages.)
- As we mentioned in our last release notes, iOS 9 is now deprecated. If you can read this, you must have upgraded!
- Fixed a bug where there were two buttons with identical functionality in the Search bar. We've consolidated down to one to avoid any confusion between the two. This is a 50% reduction in buttons and the savings will be reflected in the price of our app in the App Store.
- We chopped out some extra padding here and there, which is the opposite of what you should do if you play hockey or football.

**Android**
What’s New in Version 5.15:
- Native login is finally here! Login directly through the app, not through a web page in the app. Compatible with most password managers. (No offense to the web, you've been great. You really have.)
- Low-urgency notification rules are now separated from high-urgency notification rules! You can edit your low-urgency rules in your profile, located in the side menu. (Low-urgency rules not available on Lite packages.)

#5.14 — 24 Jan 2018
**iOS**
This will be the last release supporting iOS 9. If you're a steadfast iOS 9 user, that's okay, this version of the app will continue working for you for a long time still, but no further updates will be delivered to your device. This means we can more easily support newer iOS features.

What's New in Version 5.14:
- Improvement to the SSO login screen. It's now more clear that you're entering the subdomain, and we supply the domain. We're cool like that.
- Clarification about the length allowed for a responder message. If your message was going to be truncated for SMS, you'd want to know, right? We would.

**Android**
What's new in 5.14:
- Incidents with conference bridges now show the number more prominently, and dial the number in-app so that the extension works. You will be asked for dialing permission the first time you use this.
- Clarification about the length allowed for a custom responder message.
- Some UI polish.

#5.13 — 03 Jan 2018
**iOS**
What's New in Version 5.13:
- Select multiple incidents by long-pressing an incident in the Open Incidents list, or through the "..." menu, then acknowledge or resolve them. I'm not going to tell you what to do but the long press is way more satisfying.

**Android**
What's New in Version 5.13:
- Fixed a bug where when a user receives status update link via SMS, clicking that link redirects them to a blank page within the PD app instead of the status page of the incident.
