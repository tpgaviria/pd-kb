Your monthly user charge is determined by the highest number of full users on your account at any time during the month. A "full user" can have any type of role, as defined in your subscription plan. You can view the different full user license roles [here](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/advanced-permissions#section-what-old-roles-do-the-new-roles-correspond-with-). Limited and Full Stakeholder users are billed for at a different rate as other users depending on your plan.

The number of users you currently have can be found by going to **People** :fa-arrow-right: **Users**. If you're the account owner, you can find the highest number of users in your account for the month by going to **User Icon** :fa-arrow-right: **Account Settings**.

## Purchasing more users

If you need to add users to your annual plan, you can do so by going to **User Icon** :fa-arrow-right: **Account Settings** :fa-arrow-right: **Your Subscription** and clicking the **Add Users** button. This will co-term more users for your annual plan with a pro-rated amount based on when your annual subscription completes.

All PagerDuty customers have access to an unlimited number of email and mobile app push notifications for incidents and alerts, as well as unlimited phone and SMS notifications to numbers in the US and Canada. Customers on our Profesional, Business, or Digital Operations plans also have an unlimited number of international phone and SMS notifications.

If you're on a plan without unlimited international phone notifications, please be aware that all attempts by PagerDuty to call an on-call user are billable. This includes calls with no answer and no voicemail, as well as calls answered by voicemail (full or not).

  "title": "Credit Card Authorization Errors"
}
[/block]
If you receive a credit card authorization error, your new billing information will not be saved until the problem is corrected. In most cases authorization errors are due to address verification failure. PagerDuty verifies all billing information with your card issuer, so you may receive an authorization error even if the card has been accepted by other merchants who do not use address verification. Please make sure that you are not using an old or incorrect address, and that the postal code is correct as well.

If you recently updated your address with your card issuer and the card information you enter is not accepted by PagerDuty, please try again at a later time. Some card issuers take up to 72 hours to update your address, meaning address verification attempts will fail until this update is completed by your card issuer.

Authorization attempts may also fail if you are:

* Entering an unsupported card
We accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover and JCB.
* Entering an invalid security code
This is the 3 digit code on the back of the card if using Visa, MasterCard, Discover or JCB; or the 4 digit code above the 15 digit card number on the front of the card if using American Express.
* Entering an expired card
* Entering a card that has not yet been activated with the issuer
