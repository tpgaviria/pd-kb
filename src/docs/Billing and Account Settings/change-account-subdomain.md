PagerDuty accounts are accessible via a personalized subdomain. If your company name is EveryNine Inc, you can set your account's subdomain to everynine.pagerduty.com, e9inc.pagerduty.com, or anything else as long as it is four or more characters long.

#Changing Subdomains

If you would like to change your account's subdomain for any reason, please be mindful of the following:

1. Integration email addresses for your PagerDuty services will change.
2. Users will not be notified by PagerDuty of the subdomain change. You will need to communicate the change to other members of your team so they know when and why the old subdomain will no longer be accessible.
3. Although push notifications can still be received, the mobile app will not load and users will need to log out and log back into the app:

    **iOS:** Tap :fa-bars: and go to **Accounts**, tap **Edit**, then tap :fa-minus-circle: next to the account.
    **Android:** Tap :fa-bars: and go to **Accounts**, tap :fa-ellipsis-v: next to the account, then tap **:fa-trash: Remove this Account**.

    If these steps don't work, you can reset the app in your device settings:

    **iOS:** Settings :fa-arrow-right: PagerDuty :fa-arrow-right: Reset :fa-toggle-on:
    **Android:** Settings :fa-arrow-right: Applications :fa-arrow-right: PagerDuty :fa-arrow-right: Clear Cache


4. If you have [Single Sign On](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/sso) enabled, you will need to adjust your IdP settings to reflect your new PagerDuty subdomain.
5. There is a minimum of four characters for PagerDuty subdomains.

##Recommended Steps

To prevent any interruption in your alerting, we recommend using the following action plan  to make the necessary changes above before changing your subdomain.
