## Intelligent Dashboards

[Intelligent Dashboards](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/intelligent-dashboards) measure the impact of real-time work on teams and business objectives, promoting continuous improvement in digital operations towards greater success. Digital business leaders can receive recommendations and use flexible data visualizations to compare key metrics to industry benchmarks or teams to company averages.

* [Spotlight Recommendations](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/intelligent-dashboards#spotlight-recommendations): Spotlight’s at-a-glance insights and recommendations promote informed decisions about investments in real-time operations.
