PagerDuty Modern Incident Response includes capabilities essential for every stage of the response process for critical incidents:

##Response Plays
[Response plays](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/response-automation) design the right response automation for any impact level—mobilize responders, engage stakeholders with status updates, and set up conference bridge collaboration. Response plays can be run with a single tap from the PagerDuty mobile app, within the PagerDuty web app, or even run automatically for new incidents on mission-critical services.

##Stakeholder Communication
[Stakeholder communications](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/communicating-with-stakeholders) allow you to engage the entire business—IT management, support, executives, marketing, sales, legal, and more. Inform stakeholders with real-time status updates, enabling rapid organization-wide response without interrupting technical responders.

##Status Dashboard: Subscriptions and Multiple Dashboard Views
The [status dashboard](doc:status-dashboard) is a feature of the core PagerDuty platform that provides technical responders, business responders, and leaders a live, shared view of system health to improve awareness of operational issues. With Modern Incident Response, stakeholders using the status dashboard will also have the ability to [subscribe to business services](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/status-dashboard#section-subscribing-to-business-services) and use [multiple dashboard views](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/status-dashboard#section-multiple-dashboard-views).

##One Touch to Join Conference Bridge
The [One Touch To Join Conference Bridge](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/conference-bridge#section-one-touch-to-join-conference-bridge) feature enables rapid response team assembly by giving responders a push-button means of joining a conference bridge. One Touch to Join relies on two core PagerDuty platform features: [Conference Bridge](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/response-bridge#section-service-level-response-bridge) and [Add Responders](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/mobilizing-a-response#section-add-responders). When responders are added to an incident and receive a voice call, they will receive the option to “Join the bridge” which will immediately add them to the conference call. 

##Bi-directional ITSM Integration
With [bi-directional ITSM integration](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/how-to-triaging-major-incidents-integrating-your-itsm-toolchain#section-integrating-pagerduty-incident-response-with-itsm-tools) you can integrate with any ITSM or ticketing solution (JIRA, ServiceNow, BMC, etc.) to seamlessly incorporate PagerDuty response capabilities into your existing incident management process.

##Postmortems
[Postmortems](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/postmortems) provide a streamlined learning process for your organization to improve at resolving and preventing incidents. Simply point and click to build the timeline in minutes, allowing you to invest more time in understanding root cause and determining the most important follow-up actions.
