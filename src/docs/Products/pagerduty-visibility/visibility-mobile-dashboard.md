A business service is disrupted when an incident with a priority is triggered on a technical service connected to the business service, and the business service was not already in a disrupted state due to another incident. 

Selecting a business service will display the detailed view:

  * Name and description of the business service
  * Point of contact (if entered)
  * [Impact Metrics](doc:impact-metrics) for the business service
  * Supporting technical services

If the business service is disrupted, additional details are included:

* Priority and duration of the disrupting incident
* Timeline of any status updates *through Modern Incident Response*
* The technical services list will indicate the disrupted technical service(s)
